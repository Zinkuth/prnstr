Expectations may lead to dissapointment
---------------------------------------

This is not a book about information security. 
Certainly not about IT.
This is a book about hacking: specifically, how to infiltrate a company'snetwork, locate their most critical data, and make off with it withouttriggering whatever shiny new security tool the company wasted their budget on.
Whether youare a wannabe ethical hacker or an experienced pentester frustrated by outdatedbooks and false media reports, this book is definitely for you.
We will setup a fake - but realistic enough - target and go in detail over the main stepsto pwn the company: building phishing malware, finding vulnerabilities, rootingWindows domains, pwning a mainframe, etc.
